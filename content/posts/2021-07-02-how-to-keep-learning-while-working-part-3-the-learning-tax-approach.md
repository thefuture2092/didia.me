  While searching for an approach to keep learning while working, I got the idea
  of making my employer or clients pay me a learning tax to get better at
  serving them. In this article, I share what I discovered by adopting this
  approach, the impact it had on projects I working on and the difficulties I
  ran into while using it.

This is the third article of the series [**How to keep learning while working**](/category/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/) in which I share how I learned to find the time, energy and focus necessary to learn new things while maintaining a good work-life balance.

Previous article â˜ž [**How to keep learning while working, Part 2: What experienced people taught me about learning on the job**](/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/what-experienced-people-taught-me-about-learning-on-the-job)

After asking experienced people around me how they found time to keep getting better at their job while still spending quality time with their friends and family, I discovered that most of them used one or more of the following approaches: Learning by experience, learning on their own time or learning proactively on their company's time.

Unfortunately, none of those approaches really fitted my lifestyle or job content. Learning by experience alone wouldn't have allowed to learn as much as I wished and my job content didn't really leave a lot of room for learning on company time. So the only viable option for me was to stick to what I used to do in the past which is learning on my own time and that would have required some sacrifices from my work-life balance.

As I was getting ready to sacrifice some of my social life, an unsuspected idea came to me while filing my taxes: What If I made my employer or clients pay me a learning tax to get better at serving them ? I would actively use company time to acquire knowledge that would then be useful to my employer or my clients. That's when the learning tax approach was born.
